# NLP_BoW_sklrn_FeatureExtraction_CountVectorizer

Natural Language Processing
In this Notebook, I'm applying the python sklearn classifier to make a BoW "Bag of Words" model, to extract the features of a set of reviews on a restaurant.

Case-study:
Given the data sample of reviews on a restaurant, we're going to build a NLP model that would be able to predict whether a review is postivie or negative.
